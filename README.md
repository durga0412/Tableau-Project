# Tableau-Project
Covid 19 Dataset
Objective: The objective of this project is to understand the global covid-19 mortality rates.

The Dataset Domain: Healthcare, Covid-19.

Used the default data sets (.csv files) available. Data sets are to be related, joined, or blended to solve the following problem statements.

Problem statement:

Based on the csv. files for global mortality rates, we are going to analyze and develop a dashboard to understand the covid-19 global cases. Use filters, parameters and actions wherever possible to make the dashboard interactive.

1. Comparing the global confirmed vs. death cases in a world map using pie charts.
2. Top 5 countries based on confirmed and death cases in numbers.
3. Create a parameter for percentile comparison between countries based on confirmed or death cases.
4. Comparing the country wise cases using logarithmic axes. Dashboard should display both log axis chart and a default axis chart in an alternate interactive way.
5. New cases per day in China and India – compared in a date-wise chart. Which day has the highest new death cases?
6. Which WHO region has the highest new cases versus new deaths ratio?
7. Create a parameter to dynamically view Top N WHO regions based on cumulative new cases and death cases ratio.
8. Average WHO region-wise cumulative cases to be visualized using a funnel chart.
9. Dashboard should have a drop down menu to view the WHO region-wise data using a bar chart, line chart, or a map as per user’s requirement.
